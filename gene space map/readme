The python package pyGenomeViz was used to make the gene space map and two versions of gene space map were created.
Gene space map 1 took the length of each cds and their exact positions on the Genome into consideration with the scale on the x-axis.
Gene space map 2 ignored the scale. All the cds were presented by triangles of the same length and with same size of gaps for a better visualization.
