Hits found by blast were filtered and only those with lower E-values were kept in the data in regions/.

The python package pyGenomeViz was used to make the gene space map and two versions of gene space map were created.
Gene space map 1 took the length of each cds and their exact positions on the Genome into consideration with the scale on the x-axis.
Gene space map 2 ignored the scale. All the cds were presented by triangles of the same length and with same size of gaps for a better visualization.

The program is not good enough because the classification of cds must be done by hand. Possible improvement could be: the program reads from the data 
every cds and their pairwise corresponding cds from the template genome of Apis mellifera, stores it and colors it automatic depending on which group 
it belongs to.

Also, the cds found by Blastn were not complete. Hits of mrjp3, mrjp6, mrjp7 were not gained, thus not shown on the genome. And despite yellow-e3, yellow-h 
and mrjp1, other cds were only roughly categorized into a yellow gourp or mrjp gourp.
