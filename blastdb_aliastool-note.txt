instead of updating the blast db each time we add sequences we 
can simply create a new database for each organism/species and 
then use an alias db to 'combine' them. 
Like that we preserve more struckture.

blastdb_aliastool -dbtype <type> -dblist "<db1> <db2> <db3>" -out <alias_name>

alias_name is our new db which can access all all listed -dblist
